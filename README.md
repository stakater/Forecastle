## Admin Guide

This section is intended for Administrators aiming to deploy Forecastle in Kubernetes environments. Forecastle offers flexible deployment options, accommodating both Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms with ease.

You have the choice of deploying Forecastle using traditional Kubernetes manifests or through Helm charts. Detailed instructions for both methods are provided below to guide you through the deployment process.

### Vanilla Manifests

#### Step 1: Apply manifests

You can get Forecastle by running the following command on your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Forecastle/master/deployments/kubernetes/forecastle.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Update configmap

Modify the `namespaceSelector` key in the Forecastle ConfigMap to list the namespaces you want Forecastle to monitor. For detailed instructions, see [namespace selector configuration](#namespaceselector) for instructions.

### Helm Charts

If you have Helm configured on your Kubernetes cluster, deploy Forecastle using the Helm chart. The chart is located [here.](./deployments/kubernetes/chart/forecastle)

Adjust the configuration in values.yaml if required and run the following command:
  
```bash
helm install forecastle ./deployments/kubernetes/chart/forecastle
```

### Configuration

Forecastle simplifies the discovery and management of applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift. It utilizes specific annotations on ingresses and offers various configuration options for customization.

You can customize Forecastle using either a ConfigMap or the values.yaml file when deploying with Helm. Below are the configurable fields:

|       Field       |                                                Description                                                 |         Default         | Type              |
| :---------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------: | ----------------- |
| namespaceSelector | A fine grained namespace selector which uses a combination of hardcoded namespaces well as label selectors |        any: true        | NamespaceSelector |
| headerBackground  |                         Background color of the header (Specified in the CSS way)                          |          null           | string            |
| headerForeground  |                         Foreground color of the header (Specified in the CSS way)                          |          null           | string            |
|       title       |                                     Title for the forecastle dashboard                                     | "Forecastle - Stakater" | string            |
|   instanceName    |                                      Name of the forecastle instance                                       |           ""            | string            |
|    customApps     |                A list of custom apps that you would like to add to the forecastle instance                 |           {}            | []CustomApp       |
|    crdEnabled     |                                  Enables or disables `ForecastleApp` CRD                                   |          true           | bool              |

#### Detailed Configurations

##### NamespaceSelector

Selects namespaces for Forecastle to monitor, either by listing specific namespaces or using label selectors.

|     Field     |                                          Description                                          | Default | Type                                                                                         |
| :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      any      | Boolean describing whether all namespaces are selected in contrast to a list restricting them |  false  | bool                                                                                         |
| labelSelector |                Filter namespaces based on kubernetes metav1.LabelSelector type                |  null   | [metav1.LabelSelector](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#LabelSelector) |
|  matchNames   |                                    List of namespace names                                    |  null   | []string                                                                                     |

*Note:* If you specify both `labelSelector` and `matchNames`, Forecastle will take a union of all namespaces matched and use them.

##### Custom Apps

Allows adding non-Kubernetes or external apps to Forecastle. This is an extremely useful feature especially when your apps are distributed both on kubernetes and off it. You can pass an array of custom apps inside the config.

| Field             | Description                               | Type              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| name              | Name of the custom app                    | String            |
| icon              | URL of the icon for the custom app        | String            |
| url               | URL of the custom app                     | String            |
| group             | Group for the custom app                  | String            |
| properties        | Additional Properties of the app as a map | map[string]string |
| networkRestricted | Whether app is network restricted or not  | bool              |

#### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how you might configure Forecastle using a combination of namespace selectors and custom apps:

```yaml
namespaceSelector:
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      component: redis
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache]}
  matchNames:
  - test
title:
headerBackground:
headerForeground: "#ffffff"
instanceName: "Hello"
crdEnabled: false
customApps:
- name: Hello
  icon: http://hello
  url: http://helloicon
  group: Test
  properties:
    Version: 1.0
```

This configuration demonstrates how to set namespace selectors, customize the header's appearance, enable or disable the CRD feature, and add a custom app with specific properties.


### Scaling with Multiple Instances

Forecastle's design allows for running multiple instances, providing scalability and flexibility in diverse environments. Here's how you can effectively scale Forecastle.

#### Deploying Multiple Instances

*Basic Deployment*: To run multiple Forecastle instances, deploy each instance in a separate namespace. Specify a list of namespaces for each instance to monitor ingresses.

#### Configuring Named Instances for Enhanced Flexibility

*Named Instance Configuration*: For greater control over which applications are displayed in specific instances (irrespective of their namespaces), configure each Forecastle instance with a unique name using the `instanceName` setting in the Forecastle configuration.

#### Controlling Application Display Across Instances

*Application-Specific Instance Display*: After naming your instances, use the `forecastle.stakater.com/instance` annotation on your ingresses. This annotation dictates which application appears in which Forecastle instance.

*Multiple Instance Display*: It's possible for a single application (ingress) to appear in multiple Forecastle dashboards. For instance, if you have two instances named dev-dashboard and prod-dashboard, adding `dev-dashboard,prod-dashboard` in the ingress's instance annotation will ensure the application is visible on both dashboards.

#### Helm Deployment Considerations

*Unique Naming in Helm*: When deploying Forecastle instances via Helm, ensure each instance has a unique `nameOverride` value (default is forecastle). This step is crucial to avoid conflicts between global resources like ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding.

## User Guide

This section is intended for Users aiming to use Forecastle in their Kubernetes environments.  

### Ingresses

Forecastle identifies applications through annotations added to Kubernetes ingresses. Hereâ€™s how you would add the necessary annotations:

| Annotation                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Required |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/expose`             | Add this with value `true` to the ingress of the app you want to show in Forecastle                                                                         | `true`   |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/icon`               | Icon/Image URL of the application; An icons/logos/images collection repo [Icons](https://github.com/stakater/ForecastleIcons)                               | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/appName`            | A custom name for your application. Use if you don't want to use name of the ingress                                                                        | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/group`              | A custom group name. Use if you want the application to show in a different group than the namespace it is running in                                       | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/instance`           | A comma separated list of name/s of the forecastle instance/s where you want this application to appear. Use when you have multiple forecastle dashboards   | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/url`                | A URL for the forecastle app (This will override the ingress URL). It MUST begin with a scheme i.e., `http://` or `https://`                                | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/properties`         | A comma separate list of `key:value` pairs for the properties. This will appear as an expandable list for the app                                             | `false`  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/network-restricted` | Specify whether the app is network restricted or not (true or false)                                                                                        | `false`  |


### ForecastleApp CRD

Another way Forecastle enhances your ability to dynamically integrate applications is by using ForecastleApp Custom Resource Definition (CRD). This feature adds a layer of flexibility, allowing you to separate the application configuration from the Ingress settings and Forecastle's own configuration.  

**Creating a ForecastleApp:**

To create a ForecastleApp, use the following template as a guide. This configuration allows you to specify the app name, group, icon, URL, and additional properties:

```yaml
apiVersion: forecastle.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: ForecastleApp
metadata:
  name: app-name
spec:
  name: My Awesome App
  group: dev
  icon: https://icon-url
  url: http://app-url
  networkRestricted: "false"
  properties:
    Version: 1.0
  instance: "" # Optional
```

#### Automatically discover URL's from Kubernetes Resources

ForecastleApp CRD supports automatic URL discovery from certain Kubernetes resources, such as:

- Ingress: Ensures the application's URL is automatically retrieved from the Ingress resource in the same namespace.

To utilize this feature, add the urlFrom field to your ForecastleApp specification like so:
*Please note that the type of resource that you want to discover has to be in the same namespace as the `ForecastleApp` CR.*

```yaml
apiVersion: forecastle.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: ForecastleApp
metadata:
  name: app-name
spec:
  name: My Awesome App
  group: dev
  icon: https://icon-url
  urlFrom: # This is new
    ingressRef:
      name: my-app-ingress
```

This configuration instructs Forecastle to fetch the app URL directly from the specified Ingress resource, simplifying deployment and configuration.

*Note: To use the CRD feature, ensure it's enabled by setting `crdEnabled: true` in the Forecastle configuration or by enabling it in the Helm chart.*

## About

### Why the name "Forecastle"?

The term "Forecastle" originates from maritime vocabulary, referring to the upper deck of a ship situated at the bow, just in front of the foremast. Historically, it's a place from where sailors navigate and observe the vast sea ahead.

In the context of our project, we've adopted this name as a metaphor for the role Forecastle plays in the world of Kubernetes. Just like the ship's forecastle, our Forecastle acts as a central observation and control panel. It gives users a comprehensive view of all their running applications on Kubernetes, specifically those marked with a designated annotation. Forecastle is designed to be your Kubernetes dashboard, providing a clear view and easy access to your deployed applications, much like a sailor surveying the sea from the ship's bow.
