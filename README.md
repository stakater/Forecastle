# Forecastle

[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=IngressMonitorController&utm_medium=github)

## Problem(s)

- We would like to have a central place where we can easily look for and access our applications running on Kubernetes.
- We would like to have a tool which can dynamically discover and list the apps running on Kubernetes.
- A launchpad to access developer tools e.g. Jenkins, Nexus, Kibana, Grafana, etc.

## Solution

Forecastle gives you access to a control panel where you can see your running applications and access them on Kubernetes.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

You can deploy Forecastle both using vanilla k8s manifests or helm charts.

### Vanilla Manifests

#### Step 1: You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```bash
kubecl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Forecastle/master/deployments/kubernetes/forecastle.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Update configmap

In the Forecastle configmap modify the `namespaces.conf` key with a comma separated list of namespaces which you want Forecastle to watch.

And enjoy!

### Helm Charts

If you configured `helm` on your cluster, you can deploy Forecastle via helm chart located under `deployments/kubernetes/chart/Forecastle` folder.

## Configuration

Forecastle looks for a specific annotations on ingresses.

- Add the following annotations to your ingresses in order to be discovered by forecastle:

|           Annotation           |                                           Description                                           |
|:------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `forecastle.stakater.com/expose` | **[Required]** Add this with value `true` to the ingress of the app you want to show in Forecastle  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/icon`   | **[Optional]** Icon/Image URL of the application; An icons/logos/images collection repo [Icons](https://github.com/stakater/ForecastleIcons) |

- Once you have added these annotations, you need to specify namespaces to look for the ingresses in configmap of Forecastle. Modify the `namespaces.conf` key with a comma separated list of namespaces, in the manifest file.

## Features

- List apps found in all namespaces listed in the configmap
- Search apps
